# Coercing Types

You are given three variables, `i`, `x`, and `s`.
- `i` is *supposed* to be an integer, but it isn't.  It will be a float or a string.
- `x` is *supposed* to be a float, but it isn't.  It will be an integer or a string.
- `s` is *supposed* to be a string, but it isn't.  It will be an integer or a string.

Write three lines of code that will convert these variable to their proper types.
i = int(float(i))
x = float(x)
s = str(s)

<p>The setup code gives the following variables:</p>
<p><pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_for_user"></pl-external-grader-variables></p>

<p>Your code snippet should define the following variables:</p>
<pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user"></pl-external-grader-variables>
